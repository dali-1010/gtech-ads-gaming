        "\n",
        "**Welcome to the GrCN Gaming Video Tagging Tool!**\n",
        "\n",
        "The GrCN Gaming Video Tagging Tool is a solution designed to streamline the process of tagging video content for the GrCN Gaming initiative. It is designed to enable our clients to efficiently analyze and categorize video content locally based on predefined criteria. This tool utilize Google Sheets API, Google Cloud Storage, Vertex AI API and additionally, yt-dlp for downloading YouTube videos. This solution uses the client libraries mentioned above to interact with the respective Google Cloud services. This solution can be easily deployed for both developers and users.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture\n",
        "\n",
        "The GrCN Gaming Video Tagging Tool employs a modular architecture to facilitate the video tagging process. This solution consists of the following key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Ingestion:** The tool reads a list of video identifiers from a specified Google Sheet.\n",
        "2.  **Video Processing:** For each video identifier, the tool downloads the corresponding video content.\n",
        "3.  **AI-Powered Tagging:** The downloaded video is then analyzed powered by Google's Gemini model to analyze corresponding tags based on the video content.\n",
        "4.  **Result Output:** The generated tags for each video are then written back to the original Google Sheet in a designated output sheet.\n",
        "\n",
        "This solution allows users to easily manage and process video tagging tasks in a scalable and efficient manner, directly from their local environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Getting Started\n",
        "\n",
